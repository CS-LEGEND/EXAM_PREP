Authors must not use CESU-8, UTF-7, BOCU-1 and SCSU, also falling in that category and not intended to be used on the web. Cross-scripting attacks with some of these encodings have been documented.

If there is a space between the selector and the pseudo class selector, then the code will not work.

"IDs, on the other hand, are great for when you have exactly one element that should receive a certain kind of styling. IDs are assigned to HTML elements with the word id and an equals sign: <div id="first"></div> <div id="second"></div> <p id="intro"></p> IDs are identified in CSS with a pound sign (#): #first { height: 50px; } #second { height: 100px; } #intro { color: #FF0000; } This allows you to apply style to a single instance of a selector, rather than all instances. An id attribute can only be used once because the id is unique to the element it is assigned to. Ids have greater specificity than classes. If an HTML element is using both id and class attributes, the CSS rule for the id will take precedence over that of the class. Below we will use an id selector to style a single HTML element differently than others of that kind on the webpage. Any HTML element can have an id attribute to identify it. id elements should always be unique to that single element, and each element should never have more than one id.

"The <table> tag. Tables are very useful to store tabular data so it is easy to read! It is used when you want to present information neatly in a table with rows and columns. You can make rows in the table by using the <tr> tag/table row tag. The <td> elements adds table data. The <head> HTML tag contains information about a web page (e.g. its title), and in the same way, the <thead> tag can be thought of as containing information about a table. The <body> tag contains the contents of the web page. The <tbody> tag contains the tabular data. You add text to a <thead> similar to a <tbody>, like this: <thead> <tr> <th> Name </th> <th> Favorite Color </th> </tr> </thead> First we have an opening <thead> tag for the table head. Then we have an opening <tr> tag for the row. (to start the row) After that, a <th></th> cell for the Name column heading. Notice that we use <th></th> for the table heading cells instead of<td></td>. Then another <th></th> cell for the Favorite Color column heading. Finally, we close the row element with a closing </tr> tag, and close out the table heading element with a closing </thead> tag. Example: <tbody> <tr> <td>Banana</td> <td>$56.75</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Yogurt</td> <td>$12.99</td> </tr> </tbody> <tfoot> <tr> <td>Total</td> <td>$69.74</td> </tr> </tfoot> </table> ,",
